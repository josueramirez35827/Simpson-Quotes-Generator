# Title: Simpson-Quotes-Generator

# Description
For this project I will be implementing React with light CSS design work in order to create a simpsons quote generator from the simpsons quote API. The main features for the Generator will be a main page for the search bar that will allow the user to search for quotes based on the characters that are in The Simpsons. Once you search, it will display a grid of cards showing images of scenes where the quote happened for them to select from. After that, they can select that card in show more information such as the quote itself and the character the spoke the quote directly. The main goal will be to streamline the process of finding the perfect Simpsons Quote to impress all your friends with you witty Simpson knowledge.
